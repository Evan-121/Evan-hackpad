# Evan-hackpad

i used an oled screen, 9 keys/switches, and a xiao prosessor 

all the switches anre linked into the xiao and so is the oled so when i plug it in i can program the buttons to run spesific functions

i will use it to game controll music and  use it to controll some of my other arduino/razberry pi progects
